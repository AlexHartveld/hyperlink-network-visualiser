# My M.Sc. Thesis code regarding school networks in Austria. 
This project make several contributions on a theoretical, methodological and practical level. 

## Theoretical
- I define teaching that goes beyond the standard curriculum as an innovative activity, since good teacher constantly experiment with new interventions and ways to deal with daily and societal challenges. 
- I then apply the "Innovation Ecosystem" theory to the school sector in what seems to be a first. Here non-linear relationships are important and it predicts that there is must be a number of organizations that support innovation.

## Methodological
- I apply a Hyperlink Network Analysis, but extend it with GPT-based categorization and summary
- I visualise the network using PyVis and create two types of visualisations: a node-edge with individual school and a aggregate with found actors per category

## Practical
- These visualisations can be used by practitioners to understand the opportunities in the field or why certain innovations might (not) work
- Teachers can find organizations that already have partners without having to visit hundreds of web pages. They can do this per school category. 

The thesis is of exploratory nature and describes many potential follow-up studies based on this data. 
This notebook is not fully cleaned up and optimised yet but succesfully provides a proof of concept and has all necessary set-up procedures described. 

Two resulting visualisation examples are uploaded in this repository but the full page with visualisations is visible here:
